# Deep learning models for QA

Some Keras-based models for QA on the babi dataset. Implemented in Keras 1.*. I hope to update it soon.

1. babi_memn2n.py: An end-to-end memory network implementation including:
	* Bag of Word encoding.
	* Multiple hops 
	* Adjacent embedding layers
2. babi_rn.py: An relational network (RN) implementation for babi.
